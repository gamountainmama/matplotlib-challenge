Analysis

    The mean and median tumor volumes were noticeably lower for two drug regimens, Capomulin and Ramicane.  
    There were also more mice tested for these two regimens.  
    There was close to an even split of male (51%) and female (49%) for the mice in the study.  
    For the Infubinol treatment, there was one low outlier with a significantly lower final tumor volume than other mice treated with Infubinol.  
    A line plot shows the tumor volume of an individual mouse treated with Capomulin.  
    A scatterplot of the mice from the Capomulin treatment shows that the tumor volume generally increases as the weight of the mouse increases. A linear regression of this increase has a correlation of 0.84, which indicates it is a good fit for the data.
